# package.json of an empty project

Small observations:

- we have a package related to Babel;
- we have a package related to Expo. We will not use Expo only to create and debug the app. We will use a package related to Expo.


# Other comments

![other comments 1](images/other-comments-1.png)

I will make comments about some files, not all files.

- **App.tsx**: initial script of the app;
- **app.json**: some configurations related to the app.


# Running the app

Teacher instructed us to run the project with the followin command:

```
npm run start
```

or

```
expo start
```

In the screen teacher pressed 'w' to see the app on the web.

He also instructed us to download the Expo app in Google Play to see the app in an Android cellphone.
